# Contributor Agreement

Thank you for joining the Helpful community!

Helpful Engineering is an international, open-source community incubator focused on mobilizing people to help solve critical issues. With thousands of volunteers worldwide, our mission is to support projects through innovations in engineering, community resources, software, and manufacturing. All volunteers **must be at least 18 years old.** If you are under the age of eighteen, your parent or guardian must agree to this Contributor Agreement on your behalf.

Whether you are here to create a new project or offer support to an existing one, we’re happy you showed up. In order for us to stay focused on our mission and to do our best work, here are our Code of Conduct and Community Rules:

**Our Code of Conduct.** You agree to adopt and uphold the Helpful Code of Conduct while working with and representing the Helpful community:

- **BE KIND.** We expect everyone to act with mutual respect, dignity, and compassion. This includes abstaining from prejudicial words, or actions, involving race, gender, class, sexual orientation, gender presentation, physical ability, or religious affiliations.
- **BE COMMUNICATIVE**. Transparency is key, and you will be asked for updates on your role and activities in the community. Following existing workflows and having frequent communication keeps everyone on the same page and decreases the likelihood of critical mistakes, misunderstandings, or duplicated work.
- **BE THOUGHTFUL.** We love new ideas and new collaborations, but our community values making decisions carefully. Large decisions should be made with input from others and not unilaterally! If you have questions, ask and let’s find a solution.
- **BE ACCOUNTABLE.** Mistakes happen even with the best of intentions. If you say you’re going to do something, do it. If you can’t do it on time, inform your co-collaborators in a timely manner so that others can step in and support you.
- **BE TRUSTWORTHY.** We stress safeguarding community resources including sensitive information, passwords, personal information, and other internal data. This means you won’t divert or utilize Helpful resources or relationships towards another effort – public, or private. If you become aware of a conflict of interest, you will timely speak to an Officer or Board Director of Helpful to discuss the way forward.
- **BE CONSCIENTIOUS**. The Helpful community is counting on you to be professional. Helpful consists of many volunteers giving their time and effort. Please leave your workspace, files, and tools in an orderly fashion such that they are accessible to other members of the community. If you decide to move on from Helpful, please share your contact information with and assist the next person who will continue the excellent work that you’ve already done.
- **BE RESPECTFUL.** Many people are volunteering their time, tools, and other resources to make this effort come together, so please be respectful of individuals, their time, tools and resources. Make an effort to be professional and helpful.
- **BE HELPFUL.** Our primary goal is to do work that is helpful!
